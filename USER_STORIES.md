# Background
When patients visit a new GP or consultant, even if it's in the same medical centre, they usually have to start from scratch, re-telling the doctor about themselves and their preferences. Even when the patient is visiting the same doctor after a long break, the doctor might have forgotten most everything about them.

Doctors do have medical records, but they are not always accessible (they are partially and inconsistently computerised), and even when they are good, they take a long time to read or understand, and a lot of important context information is not available to the doctor. 

# Idea
Could we create an AI-based system that would offer doctors a shared-memory that would augment/replace the medical records, making it easy for each new doctor to get a brief AI-generated brief about the patient coming in, and allowing them to ask deeper questions as part of the preparation for each session. And the system would update the memory following (or even during) each session, similar to an assistant that would help the doctor remember the patient's details and preferences.

## As a Doctor

**Story 1: Getting patient context before consultation**
- As a doctor, I want to quickly understand a patient's medical history and preferences before they arrive, so I can provide more personalized care without making them repeat everything.

**Story 2: Remembering patient details across visits**
- As a doctor, I want to recall important details about a patient I haven't seen in months (their concerns, family situation, treatment preferences), so I can continue our relationship seamlessly.

**Story 3: Understanding patient context from colleagues**
- As a doctor, I want to understand what my colleague discussed with this patient in previous visits, so I can provide consistent care and avoid asking redundant questions.

**Story 4: Capturing consultation insights**
- As a doctor, I want to quickly record key insights and observations after a consultation, so future doctors (including myself) can benefit from this context.

## As a Patient

**Story 5: Not repeating medical history**
- As a patient, I want my new doctor to already understand my medical background and preferences, so I don't have to explain everything from scratch every time.

**Story 6: Consistent care across providers**
- As a patient, I want any doctor I see to understand my ongoing concerns and treatment preferences, so I receive consistent care regardless of who I'm seeing.

**Story 7: Feeling understood and remembered**
- As a patient, I want my doctor to remember important personal details about my life and health concerns, so I feel like a person rather than just a medical case.

**Story 8: Interpreting my follow-up flow across appointments**
- As a patient, I want help understanding the flow of my care and the context of my follow-up appointments, so I can make informed decisions about my health.
